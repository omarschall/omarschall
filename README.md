My name is Owen Marschall (he/him), and I am curious about how brains learn. And I mean this "how" in two very different senses: 1) mechanistically, how do learning signals get physically computed and communicated synapses to undergo beneficial plasticity, and 2) what changes to circuit function do synaptic adjustments effect?

My primary repository, vanilla-rtrl, contains NumPy-based modules for simluating vanilla recurrent neural networks doing a variety of simple tasks.
